//Excercises:
//1.    Modify Area2() so it becomes a property instead of a Method and call it Area. Use it to print out the area.
//2.    Create an expression bodied method Sum (Rectangle r) that takes a Rectange as an argument and return the sum of the Areas
//      of the object instance and the argument.
//3.    Create an expression bodied method Equal (...) that returns true if two reactangles are equal.
//4     Implement Equal (...) as a static Method as well as a non-static Method. Have one call the other as part of its implementation.
